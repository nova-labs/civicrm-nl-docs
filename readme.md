# CiviCRM Nova Labs Docs

The documents are here to provide a view into the design, implementation and migration of Nova Labs from `spaceman` to this CiviCRM based system.

This documentation is using Jigsaw a package that provides most of the structure for a documentation site.  Further, the content is saved within markdown files so that it can be moved easily if needed.
 
Interested in Jigsaw -> [View a preview of the docs template.](http://jigsaw-docs-staging.tighten.co/)

The documents will be hosted at civicrm-docs.nova-labs.org in the future

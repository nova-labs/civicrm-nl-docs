# Design Overview {#design-overview}

The design is based on our product selection, namely CiviCRM integarted with WordPress, as well as the requirements put together by Nova Labs leadership.

## Goal #1 {#goal-one}

The biggest goal for the choice of the design was to try and stay within the products with as little custom code as possible.  While doing this we also wanted to ensure that we covered the requirements as best as possible with the core elements chosen.

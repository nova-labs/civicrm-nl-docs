# Getting Started {#getting-started}

The project is centered around the upgrade of the main system used by Nova Labs to manage membership.  The orginal program worked well for the Nova Labs for quite some time but changes were needed that could not be easily accommodated with its technology mix.  

## CiviCRM {#page-items}

This is the main package that will be used for the membership management as well as events.  

## WordPress 

WordPress is used in conjunction with CiviCRM to provide the needed authentication.  We are going to reused the existing site that was redesigned and it will function as a authentication system.  The linkage between the two systems is via email address.

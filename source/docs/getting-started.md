# Getting Started {#getting-started}

The project is centered around the upgrade of the main system used by Nova Labs to manage membership.  The orginal program worked well for the Nova Labs for quite some time but changes were needed that could not be easily accommodated with its technology mix.  

## CiviCRM {#page-items}

This is the main package that will be used for the membership management as well as events.  

## Drupal  

Drupal provides the user authentication part of the system with Civicrm installed as Drupal module.
